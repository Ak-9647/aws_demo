- [ ] Remember conversation context: "Show more details about that anomaly we found yesterday"
- [ ] Smart recommendations: Suggest relevant follow-up analyses
- [ ] Performance: <10 second response time for complex queries

---

## 🚨 CURRENT BLOCKERS & RISKS

### None Currently! 🎉
- All infrastructure is planned and ready
- No technical blockers identified
- Budget approved for memory system
- All dependencies resolved

---

## ⏭️ NEXT IMMEDIATE ACTION

**Deploy Memory Infrastructure**:
```bash
cd /Users/akshayrameshnair/aws_demo/infrastructure
terraform apply -auto-approve
```

This will create all DynamoDB tables, Redis cluster, Lambda functions, and IAM permissions needed for the memory system.

**Estimated Deployment Time**: 10-15 minutes
**Risk Level**: Low (all configurations tested)
**Rollback Plan**: `terraform destroy -target=` specific resources if needed
