## 🔧 Integration Points

### LangGraph Workflow Integration
The gateway integrates seamlessly with the existing LangGraph workflow:

```python
# Gateway usage in workflow
gateway = get_gateway()

# Database queries
db_result = gateway.execute_database_query(
    "analytics-postgres",
    "SELECT * FROM sales_data WHERE date > '2024-01-01'"
)

# REST API calls
api_result = gateway.execute_rest_call(
    "market-data-api",
    "GET",
    "/stocks/AAPL/price"
)

# S3 data access
s3_result = gateway.access_s3_data(
    "analytics-data-lake",
    "LIST",
    "/quarterly-reports/"
)
```
