## Getting Started

### What is the Production Analytics Agent?

The Production Analytics Agent is an AI-powered system that allows you to analyze data using natural language queries. Instead of writing complex SQL queries or Python scripts, you can simply ask questions in plain English and get insights, visualizations, and analysis results.

### Key Features
- **Natural Language Processing**: Ask questions in plain English
- **Data Visualization**: Automatic chart and graph generation
- **Secure Processing**: Enterprise-grade security on AWS
- **Real-time Analysis**: Fast response times for interactive exploration
- **Multi-format Output**: Text summaries, charts, tables, and raw data

### Access Methods
1. **Web Interface**: User-friendly Streamlit dashboard
2. **API Endpoint**: Direct HTTP API for programmatic access
3. **AWS Console**: AgentCore sandbox for testing

## Using the Analytics Agent

### Basic Query Structure

The agent accepts natural language queries about your data. Here's the basic structure:

```
[Action] [Data/Metric] [Filters/Conditions] [Time Period] [Format]
```

**Examples:**
- "Show sales by region for Q4 2024"
- "Compare revenue trends between 2023 and 2024"
- "Analyze customer segments with highest retention rates"
- "Plot monthly active users for the last 6 months"

### Query Types

#### 1. Descriptive Analytics
Ask "what happened" questions:
```
- "Summarize sales performance last quarter"
- "Show top 10 products by revenue"
- "List customers with highest order values"
```

#### 2. Comparative Analytics
Compare different segments or time periods:
```
- "Compare Q3 vs Q4 sales performance"
- "Show revenue by region side by side"
- "Contrast user engagement before and after campaign"
```

#### 3. Trend Analysis
Identify patterns over time:
```
- "Show monthly revenue trends for 2024"
- "Plot user growth over the last year"
- "Analyze seasonal patterns in sales data"
```

#### 4. Segmentation Analysis
Break down data by categories:
```
- "Segment customers by purchase behavior"
- "Group products by performance categories"
- "Analyze users by geographic regions"
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues and Solutions

#### Query Not Understood
**Problem**: Agent returns "I don't understand your query"
**Solutions:**
- Rephrase using simpler language
- Break complex queries into smaller parts
- Use specific terms instead of jargon
- Include more context about what you want

#### No Data Returned
**Problem**: Query executes but returns no results
**Solutions:**
- Check date ranges (data might not exist for that period)
- Verify filter criteria (might be too restrictive)
- Confirm data source connectivity
- Try broader query parameters

#### Slow Response Times
**Problem**: Queries take too long to process
**Solutions:**
- Reduce date range scope
- Limit number of dimensions in analysis
- Use more specific filters
- Break complex queries into simpler ones

#### Visualization Issues
**Problem**: Charts don't display correctly
**Solutions:**
- Refresh the browser page
- Try different chart types
- Check data format compatibility
- Clear browser cache
