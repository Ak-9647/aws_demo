# Deployment Checklist

## Pre-Deployment Verification

### ✅ Code Quality Checks
- [ ] All Python imports resolved correctly
- [ ] No syntax errors in any Python files
- [ ] All required dependencies in requirements.txt
- [ ] Docker containers build successfully
- [ ] MCP tools configuration validated
- [ ] LangGraph workflow tested locally

### ✅ Infrastructure Readiness
- [ ] Terraform configuration validated (`terraform validate`)
- [ ] All required AWS permissions configured
- [ ] ECR repositories exist and accessible
- [ ] VPC and networking components ready
- [ ] Security groups properly configured
- [ ] IAM roles and policies validated

### ✅ Configuration Validation
- [ ] Environment variables properly set
- [ ] MCP server configuration tested
- [ ] Database connection strings configured
- [ ] Secrets Manager entries created
- [ ] Feature flags set appropriately

## Deployment Steps

### 1. Infrastructure Deployment
```bash
cd infrastructure
terraform init
terraform validate
terraform plan -out=deployment.plan
terraform apply deployment.plan
```

**Expected Resources:**
- VPC with public/private subnets
- ECS cluster and services
- DynamoDB tables (conversation history, user preferences)
- ElastiCache Redis cluster
- Aurora PostgreSQL cluster
- Application Load Balancer
- ECR repositories
- IAM roles and policies
- Cognito user pools and identity pools
- Secrets Manager entries

### 2. Container Deployment
```bash
# Build agent container
docker build -t analytics-agent ./agent/
docker tag analytics-agent:latest ${ECR_REPO}:v4.1
docker push ${ECR_REPO}:v4.1

# Build GUI container
docker build -t analytics-gui ./gui/
docker tag analytics-gui:latest ${ECR_GUI_REPO}:v4.1
docker push ${ECR_GUI_REPO}:v4.1
```

### 3. Service Updates
```bash
# Update ECS services
aws ecs update-service \
  --cluster production-analytics-agent-cluster \
  --service production-analytics-agent-service \
  --force-new-deployment

aws ecs update-service \
  --cluster production-analytics-agent-cluster \
  --service production-analytics-agent-gui-service \
  --force-new-deployment
```

## Post-Deployment Verification

### ✅ Health Checks
- [ ] ECS services running and healthy
- [ ] Load balancer health checks passing
- [ ] Database connections established
- [ ] Redis cache accessible
- [ ] MCP tools responding

### ✅ Functional Testing
- [ ] Agent HTTP endpoint responding
- [ ] GUI accessible via load balancer
- [ ] Simple query processing works
- [ ] Memory system storing conversations
- [ ] MCP tools integration working
- [ ] Authentication flow functional

### ✅ Performance Validation
- [ ] Response times under 5 seconds
- [ ] Memory usage within limits
- [ ] CPU utilization normal
- [ ] Database performance acceptable
- [ ] Cache hit rates above 80%

## Rollback Plan

### If Deployment Fails
1. **Immediate Actions:**
   ```bash
   # Rollback ECS services to previous version
   aws ecs update-service \
     --cluster production-analytics-agent-cluster \
     --service production-analytics-agent-service \
     --task-definition previous-task-definition-arn
   ```

2. **Infrastructure Rollback:**
   ```bash
   cd infrastructure
   terraform apply -target=aws_ecs_service.agent previous.tfstate
   ```

3. **Database Rollback:**
   - DynamoDB: Point-in-time recovery if needed
   - Redis: Clear cache and restart
   - PostgreSQL: Database backup restoration

### Monitoring During Rollback
- [ ] Service health restored
- [ ] Error rates decreased
- [ ] User impact minimized
- [ ] All systems operational

## Monitoring Setup

### CloudWatch Dashboards
- [ ] Agent performance metrics
- [ ] Memory system metrics
- [ ] MCP tool usage statistics
- [ ] User engagement metrics
- [ ] Error rates and alerts

### Alerting Configuration
- [ ] High error rate alerts
- [ ] Memory usage alerts
- [ ] Database connection alerts
- [ ] MCP tool failure alerts
- [ ] Performance degradation alerts

## Security Validation

### ✅ Security Checks
- [ ] All data encrypted at rest
- [ ] TLS 1.2+ for all communications
- [ ] IAM roles follow least privilege
- [ ] Security groups properly configured
- [ ] Secrets properly managed
- [ ] Audit logging enabled

### ✅ Access Control
- [ ] Cognito authentication working
- [ ] Role-based access enforced
- [ ] MFA configured for admin users
- [ ] API endpoints secured
- [ ] Database access restricted

## Documentation Updates

### ✅ Post-Deployment Documentation
- [ ] Update deployment guide with actual values
- [ ] Document any configuration changes
- [ ] Update troubleshooting guide
- [ ] Record performance baselines
- [ ] Update user guides with new features

## Success Criteria

### ✅ Deployment Successful When:
- [ ] All services healthy and running
- [ ] End-to-end functionality verified
- [ ] Performance meets requirements
- [ ] Security controls validated
- [ ] Monitoring and alerting active
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] Team trained on new features

## Common Issues and Solutions

### Container Issues
**Problem**: Container fails to start
**Solution**: Check environment variables and dependencies

### Database Issues
**Problem**: Connection timeouts
**Solution**: Verify security groups and connection strings

### MCP Issues
**Problem**: MCP tools not responding
**Solution**: Check uvx installation and server configuration

### Memory Issues
**Problem**: High memory usage
**Solution**: Review Redis configuration and cleanup policies

### Performance Issues
**Problem**: Slow response times
**Solution**: Check database queries and cache hit rates
